# MDPAgentPacman

This project creates a running Pacman program on Python that can run and win games using a Markov Decision Provess (MDP) solver. Pac-man is non-deterministic and can therefore move in a direction that may not be optimal as calculated by the MDPAgent file. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a model that studies scenarios with a set of states, a set of actions, a transition model and a reward function to move to different states as a decision maker. The MDPAgent file in this program uses the set of states that are built from the map along with the actions of moving Pac-Man in any direction (North, South, East and West) while calculating the utility of moving in each direction and taking the maximum value of those utilities to make a decision on which direction Pacman should move.
